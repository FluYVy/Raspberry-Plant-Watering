# Raspberry-Plant-Watering
*a HTL Rankweil project*

This project allows you to water your favorite plants automatically when they are thirsty. The heart of the project is a Raspberry Pi 4B, which functions as a web server, controls the pump, and reads the sensor values. And there is also a web interface, which provides you with a good overview of your plants' conditions.
